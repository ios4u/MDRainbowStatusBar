# MDRainbowStatusBar

MDRainbowStatusBar is the return of 'RainbowStatusBar'. It's made for fun, and apps featuring this will NOT probably get through the review process because of the use of 'private' API.

**I repeat, apps featuring this will NOT probably get through the review process.**

It doesn't look that good when in use either.

BUT, it's quite fun. Enjoy!
